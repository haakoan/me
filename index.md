## About Me
My name is Haakon Andresen and I am a reseacher at Stockholm University, in the astronomy department. 

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the gravitational wave signals produced by core-collapse supernovae, aiming to connect theoretical models with future observational data. 
I specialize in gravitational-wave astronomy, computational modeling of core-collpase supernova, analysis of turbulent hydrodynamis, signal anlysis, and neutrio transport.


## News
- **[February 2025]** We have been awarded ~14 million CPU hours on LUMI to perform numerical core-collapse supernovae simulations.
- **[January 2025]** I gave an interview to the Norwegian popular science radio show about our recent papers on gravitational wave memory from core-collapse supernovae.
- **[Desember 2024]** We have been awarded ~4 million CPU hours on LUMI to conduct numerical simulations of the final stages of stellar evolution.
- **[November 2024]** The python package SynthGrav is now aviable on [github](https://github.com/haakoan/SynthGrav).
SynthGrav is designed to facilitate machine learning applications, parameter estimation studies, and other data analysis tasks in the field of core-collapse supernova gravitational-wave astronomy. The package provides a fast way to generate realistic synthetic signals for burst sources. While SynthGrav is specifically designed for supernovae, its versatile framework makes it applicable to any burst source.
