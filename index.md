## About Me


My name is Haakon Andresen and I am a reseacher at Stockholm University, in the astronomy department. 

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the gravitational wave signals produced by core-collapse supernovae, aiming to connect theoretical models with future observational data. 
I specialize in gravitational-wave astronomy, computational modeling of core-collpase supernova, analysis of turbulent hydrodynamis, signal anlysis, and neutrio transport.
